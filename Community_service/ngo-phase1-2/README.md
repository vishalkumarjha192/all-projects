# NGO Management System

A MERN application for running an NGO: volunteers, managers, students, beneficiaries, donations, food, resources, tasks, events and a public website, with role-based dashboards and granular permissions. It was built in phases; each phase is a working snapshot of the whole project.

> **This folder is the snapshot for Phases 1-2.** It runs on its own: install it, seed it and log in with the demo accounts below.

## What is in this snapshot

- Project structure, MongoDB connection and all 17 Mongoose models
- Register, login, logout, forgot and reset password, with JWT
- Role and permission middleware, protected routes
- Admin screens for Users and Permissions
- Seed script with linked demo data
- The manager and volunteer dashboards are simple welcome pages in this snapshot

## Build status

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project structure, MongoDB config, all 17 Mongoose models, seed data, `.env.example` | Done |
| 2 | Register, login, logout, forgot/reset password, JWT, role + permission middleware, protected routes, admin Users and Permissions screens | Done (**this snapshot**) |
| 3 | Admin, manager and volunteer dashboards with live stats and charts | Planned |
| 4 | Core modules: volunteers, students, beneficiaries (batch 1); donations, food, resources (batch 2); tasks, events, programs (batch 3) | Planned |
| 5 | Notifications (bell, page, hourly alerts), activity log, reports with CSV and PDF export | Planned |
| 6 | Public website, website CMS, announcements, public volunteer application and donation inquiry forms | Planned |
| 7 | Route and permission audit, clean-install check, tests added to the project, final docs | Planned |

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React 18, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Hook Form, React Hot Toast, Recharts, Lucide React
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, Multer, express-validator, Helmet, express-rate-limit

## Installation

You need Node.js 18+ and a running MongoDB (local install or a free MongoDB Atlas cluster).

```bash
# 1. Server
cd server
cp .env.example .env        # then edit JWT_SECRET and MONGO_URI
npm install
npm run seed                # creates demo data
npm run dev                 # API on http://localhost:5000

# 2. Client (new terminal)
cd client
npm install
npm run dev                 # App on http://localhost:5173
```

If MongoDB is not on `127.0.0.1:27017`, edit `MONGO_URI` in `server/.env` first. Then open http://localhost:5173/login and sign in with a demo account below.

## Environment variables (`server/.env`)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | API port (default 5000) |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Long random string used to sign tokens. Never commit it |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Token lifetime, e.g. `7d` |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Frontend URL, used for CORS and password-reset links |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | Folder for uploaded files |

Generate a secret: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"`

In production set `VITE_API_URL` in `client/.env` to your API address, then run `npm run build` in `client/`.

## Demo accounts

Password for all: `Password@123`

| Role | Name | Email | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin | Vishal Kumar Jha | admin@ngo.org | Full access |
| Manager | Aryan Yadav | aryan.manager@ngo.org | Tasks, volunteers, food, events |
| Manager | Sumit | sumit.manager@ngo.org | Students, beneficiaries, tasks |
| Volunteer | Manas Jain, Ayush, Bharat, Ashish, Varun, Bhavya Anand, Aman CR, Aman | volunteer1@ngo.org to volunteer9@ngo.org (except volunteer5) | Active |
| Volunteer | Priyanshu | volunteer5@ngo.org | Pending approval (cannot log in until an admin approves) |

`npm run seed` wipes the NGO collections first and then loads linked demo records (volunteers, students, beneficiaries, donations, food, resources, programs, events and tasks). It refuses to run in production unless you add `--force`.
These are sample accounts with a shared password: never use them on a real deployment.

## How authorization works

Every protected request goes through the same steps on the server:

1. `authenticate` verifies the JWT and loads the user from the database
2. Account status must be `active`
3. `requireRole(...)` checks the role (where a route is role-specific)
4. `requirePermission('module.action')` checks the permission (admins always pass)
5. The controller runs

Roles and permissions are never trusted from the frontend. The React route guards and the sidebar filtering only improve the experience.

Permissions use the `module.action` format (for example `volunteers.edit`). Granting any action on a module also grants `module.view`. The full catalog is in `server/config/permissions.js`. Admins assign permissions from **Admin > Permissions**.

Safety rules built in:
- Public sign-up always creates a **pending volunteer**. An admin must approve it
- Only admins can change roles, permissions or reset passwords
- Non-admins with `users.create` can only create plain volunteers
- Nobody can change their own role or status
- Password change invalidates older tokens

## API overview (Phases 1-2)

| Method | Route | Access |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Public |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Public |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password` | Public |
| POST | `/api/auth/reset-password/:token` | Public |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Logged in |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Logged in |
| GET | `/api/users` | `users.view` (search, role, status, sortBy, order, page, limit) |
| GET | `/api/users/stats` | `users.view` |
| GET | `/api/users/permission-catalog` | `users.view` |
| POST | `/api/users` | `users.create` |
| GET / PUT | `/api/users/:id` | `users.view` / `users.edit` |
| PATCH | `/api/users/:id/status` | `users.edit` |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | `users.delete` (archives) |
| PATCH | `/api/users/:id/role` | Admin |
| PATCH | `/api/users/:id/permissions` | Admin |
| POST | `/api/users/:id/reset-password` | Admin |

Responses: `{ "success": true, "message": "...", "data": {} }` or `{ "success": false, "message": "..." }`.

## Forgot password in development

No email provider is connected yet. In development the reset link is printed in the server console and shown on the forgot-password page. In production, connect a provider in `server/utils/mailer.js`.

## Folder structure

```
server/
  config/        db connection, roles + permission catalog
  controllers/   thin request handlers
  middleware/    auth, permissions, validation, sanitizing, uploads, errors
  models/        17 Mongoose models
  routes/        route definitions
  services/      business logic
  utils/         helpers (errors, tokens, logging, mailer)
  validators/    express-validator rules
  seed.js
client/src/
  components/  context/  hooks/  layouts/  routes/  services/  utils/
  pages/{admin,manager,volunteer,auth,public}
```

## Known gaps (by design, for later phases)

- Dashboards for manager and volunteer are simple welcome pages until Phase 3
- Only Users and Permissions modules exist in the sidebar so far; each new module appears automatically when its navigation entry and API are added
- Uploads: Multer middleware with type and size validation is ready; upload endpoints arrive with the modules that use them
